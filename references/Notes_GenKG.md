# Generating Knowledge Graphs (KG)

This repository provides a comprehensive solution for generating Knowledge Graphs from various data sources. Knowledge Graphs are powerful tools for organizing and representing information in a structured and machine-readable format, enabling advanced analytics, knowledge discovery, and decision-making. Mastery of KG can be portable across industries such as Legal, Medical, Financial, etc. This skill may/will bring sustainable opportunities for Consultancy, building pay-per-use micro SaaS by solo-prenours

## Reasoning
- Ikigai: Word needs, ready to pay, I am good at, I like (this automation for sure)
- Specific knowledge is IR + KG + NLP + LLM + ML + DL unattainable
- Projects: GSOC mentor, RAG KG demos, talks {GDE, Ninja, MVP} 

## Product Specs: 
- [{KG + LLM} chatbot](https://medium.com/technology-hits/specs-for-chatbot-on-knowledge-graph-using-large-language-models-dedcff0ab553) Building LLM based Chatbot on Knowledge Graph
- [Knowledge as a Service (KaaS)](https://medium.com/technology-hits/specs-for-knowledge-as-a-service-kaas-project-9e2d9a7e0775) Building Knowledge Graph from Text and serving it as a Service

## Usage

### Data Extraction
1. Implement data extraction functions to retrieve data from various sources (e.g., databases, CSV files, web APIs).
2. Preprocess the data as needed, such as cleaning, normalizing, and transforming it into a format suitable for Knowledge Graph generation.
3. Use traditional regex, or ML based CRF++, or DL based LSTM or LLM based models (Prompts, Fine-tuned) to do IR (Information Retrieval), or basically NER(Named Entity Recognition) and RE (Relationship Extraction).

### Knowledge Graph Generation
1. Define the ontology or schema for your Knowledge Graph, specifying the entities, relationships, and properties.
2. Use the `rdflib` library to create RDF triples based on the extracted data and the defined ontology.
3. Store the RDF triples in a triplestore or a graph database for efficient querying and storage.
4. Storage can be in open source DBpedia or commercial Neo4j.

### Visualization
1. Leverage libraries like `networkx` and `matplotlib` to visualize the generated Knowledge Graph.
2. Provide options for customizing the visualization, such as node and edge styles, layout algorithms, and filtering.

## Advantages RAG on KG
1. Properitary data, IP
2. Can do by direct KG similary based query or by first converting to cypher or SPARQL
3. Less Hallucination
4. More debug-ability if things go wrong, compared to plain text
